Welcome to the Therify app

repo for backend: https://github.com/nwactor/therifybackend

Our app was built by Group 3 at the UC Berkeley Extension Coding Boot Camp March 2018 consisting of: 
Vaibhav Tank, Denis Wu, Nick Wactor, Yusuf Mekias, Hillari Malle, and Mike Thompson

The purpose of our app is to verify that a photo or video submitted by a user has been verified as authentic. Our app will verify that the photo or video was actually captured at the location and time the user claims by verifying that the metadata and Google Maps gps location and timestamps match. This prevents a user from claiming that a submitted photo was taken from a different location or time. For example, if a user witnesses an act of violence or a weather phenomena, the exact location and time of the event will be posted with the photo or video and the submission will be marked 'Therified'. This app would be extremely useful for anyone who wishes to documents events without the authenticity being questioned. The app also does not provide the location from which the photo or video was uploaded, protecting the users identity. This would be useful if, for example, a user captures illegal activity or simply wishes to remain an anonymous witness.

Technology Used:
React Native, Expo XDE, npm packages, AWS
